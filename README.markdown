MD5 Brute Description:
======
Going through the chars in @char and using md5 to find if the string matches.
If the class is initialized with the bool true (var with_db) then the tries will be saved in
a sqlite database for faster lookups. The first try will go slower though.

Have not had the time to optimize or think about it so much, it works and that's all right
with me.
